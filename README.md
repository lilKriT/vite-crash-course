# vite-crash-course

My first project in Vite. Following the official docs.
Created by lilKriT.

# Tutorial

`yarn create vite`

then, follow the instructions.

`index.html` is the entry point.
Vite will find any code references in it, and it will rebase all the URLs.
It can support multiple .html entry points.
Root is referenced as <root>
You can change current root with
`vite serve some/sub/dir`

Run:
`dev` or `vite`, `vite dev`, `vite serve`
`build` or `vite build`
`preview` or `vite preview` (this makes a production build and runs it locally)
